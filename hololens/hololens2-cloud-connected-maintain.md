# Maintain - Cloud connected Guide

## Updates

Microsoft designed Windows Update for Business to provide IT administrators with additional Windows Update-centric management capabilities, such as the ability to deploy updates to groups of devices and to define maintenance windows for installing updates.

Learn how to [manage HoloLens updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-updates) including scheduled days, scheduled time, and setting active hours on the device so it will update outside of working hours.

Remote Assist is an In-Box app, and can be update through the Microsoft Store app. For all apps that are downloaded through the Microsoft Store they can be [updated through the Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/holographic-store-apps#update-apps) app itself manually.

## Support Plan

A support plan is an excellent thing to have in place. Having someone, or a group trained up on troubleshooting the enrollment process on HoloLens devices and also general use of the HoloLens device within your organization is useful. In order to allow your users to have the faster resolution of their issues, we suggest that your escalation process is handled in a similar manner to this order:

1. Your Support desk.
2. Your HoloLens Expert team
3. [HoloLens Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/) / [HoloLens Troubleshooting Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-troubleshooting)
4. [Contact Support](https://support.serviceshub.microsoft.com/supportforbusiness/create?sapId=e9391227-fa6d-927b-0fff-f96288631b8f)

## Development Plan

With your device successfully enrolled you are now prepared to deploy Line of Business apps (LOB apps) to your devices. These are custom apps built for your organization&#39;s needs.

If you already have a line of business app then you&#39;re ready to [deploy your app through MDM](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/app-deploy-intune). If you&#39;d prefer a different method then review the [application deployment overview for HoloLens 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/app-deploy-overview) to learn more methods of deploying your LOB app to your devices.

If you&#39;ve yet to create your own LOB app or are still in the process of creation then review our mixed reality development docs to [start designing and prototyping](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/design/design) or learn the core concepts to [get started with mixed reality development.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/discover/get-started-with-mr)

## Device Management 

While this guide talked about setting up Mobile Device Management (MDM) it wasn't employed to apply device restrictions or policies were applied to devices. Device management can be used to both to allow access by pushing certificates, or restrict access with a variety of device restrictions. 

In many cases devices can have connectivity restrictions such as Bluetooth, VPN, USB or even turning off access to the camera or microphone. If any of these interests you then we encourage you to read our [common device restrictions page](hololens-common-device-restrictions.md).

There are other more complex device restrictions you can use. Such as:

- Limiting the pages that can be viewed in the Settings app by using [SettingsPageVisibility](settings-uri-list.md), allowing users to only access the settings they need to adjust such as changing their Wi-Fi connection.
- Use [Kiosk mode](hololens-kiosk.md) to limit the UI presented to users on a device. You can set Kiosks to show a single app, or multiple apps with a custom start page. Kiosks can also present different experiences to different users.  
- [Windows Application Control (WDAC)](windows-defender-application-control-wdac.md) to keep specific apps or processes from launching entirely.

If you'd like to learn about more different methods of device management or device restrictions, then take the next step and read our Device Management Overview.
