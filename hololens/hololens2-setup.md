# Get your HoloLens 2 ready to use

The procedures below will help you set up a HoloLens 2 for the first time.

## Charge your HoloLens

Connect the power supply to the charging port by using the USB-C cable (included). Plug the power supply into a power outlet. The power supply and USB-C-to-C cable that come with the device are the best way to charge your HoloLens 2. The charger supplies 18W of power (9V at 2A). Using the wall charger supplied, HoloLens 2 devices can charge the battery to full in less than 65 minutes when the device is in standby.

Charging rate and speed may vary depending on the environment in which the device is running.

- When the device is charging, the battery indicator lights up to indicate the current level of charge.  The last light will fade in and out to indicate active charging.
- When your HoloLens is on, the battery indicator displays the battery level in increments.
- When only one of the five lights is on, the battery level is below 20 percent.
- If the battery level is critically low and you try to turn on the device, one light will blink briefly, then go out.

Full [details on device charging can be read here](hololens-recovery.md#charge-the-device) if more information is needed. 

## Adjust fit

Place the HoloLens 2 on your head. If you wear eyeglasses, leave them on.  The brow pad should sit comfortably on your forehead and the back band should sit in the middle-back of your head.

If necessary, extend the headband by turning the adjustment wheel, and then loosen the overhead strap.

### Attach and detach the overhead strap

The overhead strap isn't required, but it can make wearing HoloLens 2 more comfortable during long periods of use.

To detach the front of the overhead strap, unhook the strap and slide it through the retractable loop on the brow pad. To reattach it, pull out the loop and slide the strap back through.

To detach the back of the overhead strap, press the button below each connection tab and pull gently. To reattach it, push the connection tabs back into the slots until they click.

## Safety and comfort

### Use HoloLens in safe surroundings

Use your HoloLens in a safe space, free of obstructions and tripping hazards. Don’t use it when you need a clear field of view or can't commit your full attention, such as while you’re operating a vehicle or doing other potentially hazardous activities.

### Stay comfortable

Keep your first few sessions with HoloLens brief and be sure to take breaks. If you experience discomfort, stop and rest until you feel better. This might include temporary feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or dry eyes.
