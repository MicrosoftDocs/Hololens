# HoloLens 2 hardware

![HoloLens 2 side view](images/hololens2-breakdown.png)

Microsoft HoloLens 2 is an untethered holographic computer.  It refines the holographic computing journey started by HoloLens (1st gen) to provide a more comfortable and immersive experience paired with more options for collaborating in mixed reality.

## HoloLens components

- **Visor**. Contains the HoloLens sensors and displays. You can rotate the visor up while wearing the HoloLens.
- **Headband**. To put the HoloLens on, use the adjustment wheel to expand the headband. With the HoloLens in place, tighten the adjustment wheel by turning to the right, until the headband is comfortable.
- **Brightness buttons**. When wearing the HoloLens, the brightness buttons are on the left side of the visor near your temple.
- **Volume buttons**. When wearing the HoloLens, the volume buttons are on the right side of the visor near your temple.
- **Power button**. When wearing the HoloLens, the power button is located on the right side of the rear outer cover.
- **USB-C port**. When wearing the HoloLens, the USB-C port is located on the right side of the rear outer cover below the Power button.

## In the box

- **Brow pad**. You can remove and replace the brow pad, as needed.
- **Overhead strap**. When you're wearing the HoloLens while moving around, use the overhead strap to help keep the device in place. When wearing the HoloLens for extended periods, the overhead strap may make the device more comfortable to wear.
- **USB-C cable**. Use the USB-C cable to connect your HoloLens to the power supply for charging, or to connect your HoloLens to your computer.
- **Power supply**. Plugs into a power outlet.
- **Microfiber cloth**. Use to clean your HoloLens visor.

### Power Supply details

The power supply and the USB cable that come with the device are the best supported mechanism for charging. The power supply is an 18W charger.  Its supplies 9V at 2A.

Charging rate and speed may vary depending on the environment in which the device is running.

In order to maintain/advance Internal Battery Charge Percentage while the device is on, it must be connected minimum to a 15W charger.
