Here are some tips on how to stay comfortable and have the best experience using your HoloLens.

## I'm experiencing discomfort when I use my device. What should I do?

If you experience discomfort, take a break until you feel better. Try sitting in a well-lit room and relaxing for a bit. The next time your use your HoloLens, try using it for a shorter period of time at first.

## I can't see the whole holographic frame, or my holograms are cut off

To see the top edge of the holographic frame, move the device so it sits higher on your head, or angle the headband up slightly in front. To see the bottom edge, move the device to sit lower on your head, or angle the headband down slightly in front. If the left or right edge of the view frame isn't visible, make sure the HoloLens visor is centered on your forehead.

## I need to look up or down to see holograms

Try adjusting the position of your device visor so the holographic frame matches your natural gaze. Here's how:

- **If you need to look up to see holograms**. First, shift the back of the headband a bit higher on your head. Then use one hand to hold the headband in place and the other to gently rotate the visor so you have a good view of the holographic frame.
- **If you need to look down to see holograms**. First, shift the back of the headband a bit lower on your head. Then place your thumbs under the device arms and your index fingers on top of the headband, and gently squeeze with your thumbs to rotate the visor so you have a good view of the holographic frame.

## The device slides down when I'm using it, or I need to make the headband too tight to keep it secure

The overhead strap can help keep your HoloLens secure on your head, particularly if you're moving around a lot. The strap may also let you loosen the headband a bit. [Learn how to use it](hololens1-setup.md#adjust-fit).

You can also experiment with the positioning of the headband&mdash;depending on your head size and shape, you may need to slide it up or down to reposition it on your forehead.

## My HoloLens feels heavy on my nose

If your HoloLens is adjusted correctly, the nose pad should rest lightly on your nose. If it feels heavy on your nose, try rotating the visor up or adjusting the angle of the headband. You can also slide the device visor out&mdash;grasp the device arms just behind the visor and pull forward gently.

## How can I adjust HoloLens to fit with my glasses?

The device visor can slide in and out to accommodate eyewear. Grasp the device arms just behind the visor and pull forward gently to adjust it.

## My arm gets tired when I use gestures. What can I do?

When using gestures, there's no need to extend your arm out far from your body. Keep it closer to your side, where it's more comfortable and will get less tired. [Learn more about gestures](hololens1-basic-usage.md#use-hololens-with-your-hands).
