# Insider preview for Microsoft HoloLens

Welcome to the latest Insider Preview builds for HoloLens! [Get started](#start-receiving-insider-builds) and provide valuable feedback on HoloLens for our next major operating system update.

> [!TIP]
>
> Organizations that have moved, or are moving toward, production deployment at scale should keep a subset of test devices on Insider builds to validate new features and builds.

## Windows Insider release notes

Looking for a new feature but don't see it? We released many new features as part of the main builds. Check out the [release notes](hololens-release-notes.md) if you think a feature might be missing.

> [!NOTE]
> Only devices in the [Dev channel](#start-receiving-insider-builds) receive these Insider build features.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This next update is on a newer codebase than what currently is available in the main builds. After you update a device to this build, your device won't update to our monthly releases until those releases catch up to the newer codebase. If necessary, you can still flash your device to go back to the general release.

| Feature   | Description  | User or scenario | Available in build |
|-----------|--------------|---|---|
|[Update to eye tracking calibration](#eye-calibration-updates)|The option to perform eye tracking calibration is shown on the device even if it has been deployed via Autopilot. | All | 10.0.22621.1296|
|[Fixes and improvements](#fixes-and-improvements)  | Additional fixes and improvements for HoloLens. | All   | 10.0.22621.1296 |

### Eye calibration updates

The option to perform eye tracking calibration is now shown on the device even if it has been deployed via Autopilot.  Customers still have the option to disable this behavior via the existing [Mixed Reality policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-mixedreality#skipcalibrationduringsetup):

- URI value: ./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/MixedReality/SkipCalibrationDuringSetup

With this change, any user on the device can choose to run eye calibration at any time to improve their experience.

### Fixes and improvements

- Fixed an issue where the user picture displayed does not match the selected user on the sign in screen if [MixedReality/PreferLogonAsOtherUser](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-mixedreality#preferlogonasotheruser) policy is enabled.

- Fixed an issue where the user list cannot be dismissed by clicking on the "Add User" or the "Other User" buttons on the sign in screen if [MixedReality/PreferLogonAsOtherUser](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-mixedreality#preferlogonasotheruser) policy is enabled.

## Start receiving Insider builds

This section explains the steps to prepare devices and then the steps to receive Insider builds.
> [!TIP]
>
> Once you enroll a device into Insider builds, we strongly recommend that your organization keeps a set of test devices enrolled, too. With a set of test devices, your organization can validate builds more easily as they come out. Timely and efficient validation creates an easier experience and helps if your normal production devices are blocked from Insider builds.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Windows Insider is moving to Channels. The **Fast** ring will become the **Dev Channel**, the **Slow** ring will become the **Beta Channel**, and the **Release Preview** ring will become the **Release Preview Channel**. Here’s how that mapping looks:

### Prerequisites

These steps explain what to do before you sign up for Insider builds. 

1. Enable telemetry. Normally optional, telemetry is required to enroll your device in Insider builds.

   1. In the **Settings app** > **Privacy** > **Diagnostics & feedback** > **Optional diagnostics data**.

   1. **Enable** telemetry.

1. Get the latest build. Reboot your device using one of two methods:
     - Use the voice command "Reboot device."
     - Choose the restart button in Settings.

### Access the Windows Insider Program and check for updates

1. On a HoloLens 2 device, go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** > **Get started**.

1. Link to the account you used to register as a Windows Insider.

1. Select **Active development of Windows**.

1. Choose whether you'd like to receive **Dev Channel** or **Beta Channel** builds.

1. Review and accept the program terms.

1. Select **Confirm** > **Restart Now**. Your device will reboot.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Check for updates** to get the latest build.

### Update error 0x80070490 workaround

If you encounter update error 0x80070490 when updating on the Dev or Beta channel, try the following short-term workaround. It involves moving your Insider channel, picking up the update, and then moving your Insider channel back.

#### Stage one - Release Preview

1. Select **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** > **Release Preview Channel**.

1. Select **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update** > **Check for updates**.

1. Accept any available update. After the update, continue to Stage two.

#### Stage two - Dev Channel

1. Select **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** > **Dev Channel**.

1. Select **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Update** > **Check for updates**.

1. Accept any available update.

## FFU download and flash directions

1. To test with a flight signed `.ffu`, flight unlock your device prior to flashing the flight signed FFU:

   - On a PC:
      1. Download `.ffu` to your PC from [https://aka.ms/hololenspreviewdownload](https://aka.ms/hololenspreviewdownload).
      1. Install [ARC (Advanced Recovery Companion) from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8): [https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8).

   - On HoloLens:
      1. Open **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program**.
      1. Sign up.
      1. Reboot the device.

1. Flash FFU. Now you can flash the flight signed FFU using ARC.

## Provide feedback and report issues

Use [the Feedback Hub app](hololens-feedback.md) on your HoloLens to provide feedback and report issues. Feedback Hub helps you include the necessary diagnostics information to help our engineers quickly debug and resolve any problem. Report issues with the Chinese and Japanese versions of HoloLens the same way.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Be sure to select **Yes** when a prompt asks whether you'd like Feedback Hub to access your documents folder.

## Note for developers

You're welcome and encouraged to try developing your applications using Insider builds of HoloLens. Check out the [HoloLens Developer Documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/development) to get started. Those instructions also work with Insider builds for HoloLens. Use the same builds for Unity and Visual Studio that you're already using for HoloLens development.

## Stop receiving Insider builds

If you no longer want to receive Insider builds of Windows Holographic, you have two options:

- Opt out on a HoloLens running a production build:
   1. Go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** > **Stop Insider builds**.
   1. Follow the instructions to opt out your device.

- Use the ARC to [recover your device](hololens-recovery.md) to a non-Insider version of Windows Holographic.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> A known issue causes users who un-enroll from the Windows Insider program, and then manually install a fresh Insider preview build, to experience a blue screen. Afterward, the user must recover the device manually. Learn more about this [Known Issue](hololens-troubleshooting.md#blue-screen-after-unenrolling-from-insider-preview-on-a-device-flashed-with-an-insider-build).
>
> To verify that your HoloLens is running a production build:
>
> 1. Locate the build number through **Settings** > **System** > **About**.
> 1. [Check the build number against the release notes for production build numbers](hololens-release-notes.md).
