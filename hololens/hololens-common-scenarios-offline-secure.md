# Common Scenarios – Offline Secure HoloLens 2

## Overview

This guide provides guidance for applying a sample Provisioning Package that will lock down a HoloLens 2 for use in secure environments with the following restrictions:
-	Disable WiFi.
-	Disable BlueTooth.
-	Disable Microphones.
-	Prevents adding or removing provisioning packages.
-	No user can enable any of the above restricted components.

## Prepare

Windows 10 PC Setup
1. [Download the latest HoloLens 2 OS file](https://aka.ms/hololens2download) directly to a PC. 
   1. Support for this configuration is included in Build 19041.1117 and above.
1. Download/Install the Advanced Recovery Companion(ARC) tool [from the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8) to your PC
1. Download/Install the latest [Windows Configuration Designer (WCD)](https://www.microsoft.com/p/windows-configuration-designer/9nblggh4tx22?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) tool from the Microsoft Store to your PC.
1. [Download the OfflineSecureHL2_Sample folder with the project files](https://aka.ms/HoloLensDocs-SecureOfflineSample) to build the PPKG.
1. Prepare your offline [Line of Business application for PPKG deployment](app-deploy-provisioning-package.md). 


## Configure

1. Once the provisioning package completes select **OK**.
1. You should then be prompted to sign into the device with the shared local account and password.

## Maintain

With this configuration, it is recommended to restart the process above and reflash the device with the ARC tool and apply a new PPKG to make any updates to the OS and/or application(s).
