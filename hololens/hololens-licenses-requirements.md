# License requirements

## Mobile Device Management (MDM) Licenses Guidance

If you plan on managing your HoloLens devices, you will need Azure AD and an MDM. Active Director (AD) cannot be used to manage HoloLens devices.
If you plan on using an MDM other than Intune, an [Azure Active Directory Licenses](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) is required.
If you plan on using Intune as your MDM, read up on the [list of suites](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/fundamentals/licenses) that include Intune licenses. **Please note that Azure AD is included in the majority of these suites.**

## Identify the licenses needed for your scenario and products

### HoloLens (1st gen) Licenses Requirements

You may need to upgrade your HoloLens (1st gen) device to Windows Holographic for Business. (See [HoloLens commercial features](holoLens-commercial-features.md#feature-comparison-between-editions) to determine if you need to upgrade).

 If so, you will need to do the following:

- Acquire a HoloLens Enterprise license XML file
- Apply the XML file to the HoloLens. You can do this through a [Provisioning package](hololens-provisioning.md) or through your [Mobile Device Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/intune/configuration/holographic-upgrade)

### Remote Assist License Requirements

Make sure you have the required licensing and device, which you can check in the [requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/requirements) documentation.

1. [Remote Assist License](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/buy-and-deploy-remote-assist)
    1. Or try a [Remote Assist trial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/try-remote-assist)
1. [Teams Freemium/Teams](https://products.office.com/microsoft-teams/free)
1. [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) License](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis)

If you plan on implementing **[this cross-tenant scenario](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/cross-tenant-overview#scenario-2-leasing-services-to-other-tenants)**, you may need an Information Barriers license. Please see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/cross-tenant-licensing-implementation#step-1-determine-if-information-barriers-are-necessary) to determine if an Information Barrier License is required.
