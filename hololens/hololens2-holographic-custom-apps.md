# Manage custom apps for HoloLens 2

HoloLens supports many existing applications from the Microsoft Store, and new apps built specifically for HoloLens. 

For more information about store apps, see [Manage apps with the store](holographic-store-apps.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For enterprise deployments, we don't recommend enabling Developer Mode, which both of these methods use. If you're interested in a secure app deployment method, please review our [App Management: Overview](app-deploy-overview.md).

If you're looking for either developer method of app installation for HoloLens 2 devices, refer to:

- [Device Portal: Installing an App](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal#installing-an-app)
- [Using Visual Studio to deploy and debug Apps](/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-visual-studio)

See our [guide](holographic-custom-apps.md) if you'd like to deploy custom apps on HoloLens (1st gen).
