# Encryption and data protection

Encryption and Data Protection protects data when the device is lost or stolen and prevents unauthorized applications from accessing sensitive information.

## BitLocker device encryption

BitLocker is a full-volume encryption feature for integrity protection of Read Only (RO) media and privacy protection of writable media.  Since its inception, it has been an effective shield against unauthorized access to the data during offline attacks. HoloLens 2 enables Bitlocker Device Encryption (BDE) by default to protect data from any unauthorized physical access to the device. Always evolving to meet the needs of the future, Microsoft continues to invest and enhance this technology.

BDE is a data protection feature that employs AES-XTS-256 encryption on all volumes in the state-separated layout of the device. BDE provides device level encryption in a state-separated layout. BitLocker Device Encryption is enabled automatically on operating system and fixed data volumes and cannot be turned off, even by IT administrators, so that the device is always protected.

BDE encryption keys are then used to transparently decrypt binaries and the data required to boot the device. As the operating system volume is unlocked and a system is booting up, other volumes become accessible using a volume-specific version of the auto-unlock protector. No other protectors are available to maintain user privacy and the drive can only be unlocked on the same device. Read Only (RO) enforcement on required volumes is applied and enforced immediately, starting from the first boot.

## Azure integration 

HoloLens 2 enables customers to integrate their devices with Azure services. Communications between HoloLens 2 devices and Azure use TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol to protect data traveling between itself and cloud services which delivers strong authentication, message privacy, and integrity. All Azure services fully support TLS 1.2 and any services where customers are using only TLS 1.2 only accept TLS 1.2 traffic. Azureâ€™s encryption standards for data in transit are detailed in [Azure encryption overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-overview). Visit the Azure documentation to learn more about [best practices for Azure data security and encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/data-encryption-best-practices). 

OneDrive, an example of cloud integration with HoloLens 2, has an auto upload feature where your files and documents can be automatically uploaded to the cloud when connected to the internet. Pausing automatic syncing of files cannot be turned off via policy but is directly configurable via the UX.
