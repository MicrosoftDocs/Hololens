# Get your HoloLens (1st gen) ready to use

Follow along to set up a HoloLens (1st gen) for the first time.

## Charge your HoloLens (1st gen)

To charge your HoloLens, connect the power supply to the charging port by using the included Micro USB cable. Then plug the power supply into a power outlet. When the device is charging, the battery indicator will light up in a wave pattern.

When your HoloLens is on, the battery indicator shows the battery level in increments. When only one of the five lights is on, the battery level is below 20 percent. If the battery level is critically low and you try to turn on the device, one light will blink briefly, then go out.

> [!TIP]
> To get an estimate of your current battery level, say "Hey Cortana, how much battery do I have left?"

The power supply and USB cable that come with the device are the best way to charge your HoloLens (1st gen).  The power supply provides 18W of power (9V 2A).

Charging rate and speed may vary depending on the environment in which the device is running.

## Turn on your HoloLens

Use the power button to turn HoloLens on and off or to put it in standby mode.

If your device doesn't respond or won't start, see [Restart, reset, or recover HoloLens](hololens-restart-recover.md).

When your HoloLens is off or in standby, turn it on by pressing the power button for one second. If it doesn't turn on, plug it in and charge it for at least 30 minutes.

> [!TIP]
> To restart HoloLens, say "Hey Cortana, reboot the device."

### Put HoloLens in standby

To put your HoloLens in standby while it's turned on, press the power button once. The battery indicators blink off. To wake it from standby, press the power button again.

HoloLens automatically goes into standby after 3 minutes of inactivity. When it's in standby, it automatically shuts down after 4 hours, or after the battery level drops by 10 percent.

### Shut down HoloLens

To shut down (turn off) HoloLens, hold the power button down for four seconds. The battery indicators turn off one by one and the device shuts down.

HoloLens automatically shuts down when the battery level drops to one percent, even if it's plugged in. After you've recharged the battery to three percent, you'll be able to turn HoloLens on again.

## Adjust volume and brightness

The brightness and volume buttons are on top of the device arms&mdash;volume to your right and brightness to your left.

## Safety and comfort

### Use in safe surroundings

Use your HoloLens in a safe space that’s free of obstructions and tripping hazards. Don’t use it when you need a clear field of view and your full attention, such as while you’re operating a vehicle or doing other potentially hazardous activities.

### Stay comfortable

Keep your first few sessions with HoloLens brief and be sure to take breaks. If you experience discomfort, stop and rest until you feel better. This might include temporary feelings of nausea, motion sickness, dizziness, disorientation, headache, fatigue, eye strain, or dry eyes.
