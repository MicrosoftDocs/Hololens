# Deployment Guide – Cloud connected HoloLens 2 with Remote Assist – Overview

This guide helps IT professionals plan for and deploy Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices to their organization with the overall goal of having those devices cloud connected to your organization with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist ready to use. Keep in mind, this will serve as a model for proof-of-concept deployments to your organization across a variety of HoloLens 2 use cases.

During the guide we will cover how to enroll your devices into your device management, apply licenses as needed, and validate that your end users are able to immediately use Remote Assist upon device setup. To do this we will go over the important pieces of infrastructure needed to get set up and running – achieving deployment at scale with HoloLens 2.

## In this Guide

This guide has the specific goal of setting up Remote Assist within your organization on your HoloLens devices. We will cover the necessities needed to achieve that goal. In order to maintain focus on this goal certain preparation and configurations will be pre-selected in order to optimize for this deployment or to reduce the items needed to configure. You will be informed of these choices, and can customize your deployment based on your business needs.

This is a set up similar to [Scenario A: Deploy to cloud connect devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/common-scenarios#scenario-a), which is a good option for many Proof of Concept deployments, which will include:

- Wi-Fi networks are typically fully open to the Internet and Cloud services
- Azure AD Join with MDM Auto Enrollment -- MDM (Intune) Managed
- Users sign in with their own corporate account (Azure AD)
  - Single or multiple users per device supported
- Varying levels of device lockdown configurations are applied based on specific use cases, from Fully Open to Single App Kiosk

No other device restrictions or configurations will be applied in this guide, however we encourage you to explore those options after finishing.

## Learn about Remote Assist

Remote Assist allows for collaborative maintenance and repair, remote inspection, as well as knowledge sharing and training. By connecting people in different roles and locations a technician using Remote Assist can connect with a remote collaborator on Microsoft Teams. They can combine video, screenshots, and annotations to solve problems in real time even when they aren&#39;t in the same location. Remote collaborators can insert reference images, schematics, and other helpful information the technician&#39;s physical space so they can refer to the schematic while working heads-up and hands-free on HoloLens.
