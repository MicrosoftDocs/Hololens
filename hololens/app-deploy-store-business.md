# Microsoft Store for Business

The Microsoft Store for Business is designed primarily for IT decision-makers and administrators in businesses or organizations with a flexible way to find, acquire, manage, and distribute free and paid apps in select markets to Windows 10 devices in volume. 

You can manage Microsoft Store apps and private line-of-business apps in one inventory, and assign and re-use licenses as needed. You can also choose the best distribution method for your organization: directly assign apps to individuals and teams, publish apps to private pages in Microsoft Store, or connect with management solutions for more options.

When Microsoft Store for Business is used by an end user they will launch the Microsoft Store app. Once launched the user will be able to select the tab with their organizations name, they will then be presented with the apps available to them or that device.

> [!Note] 
> Microsoft Store for Business does not automatically download (push) apps to devices. However, apps from the Microsoft Store for Business can be associated with your device management (MDM) server to target and sync apps to devices.
