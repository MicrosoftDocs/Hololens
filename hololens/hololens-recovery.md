# Restart, reset, or recover HoloLens 2

## Charge the device

Before you start any troubleshooting procedure, make sure that your device is charged to 20 to 40 percent of battery capacity if possible. Use the charger and the USB Type-C cables that come with the HoloLens 2 device. The power supply and USB-C-to-C cable that come with the device are the best way to charge your HoloLens 2. The charger supplies 18W of power (9V at 2A). Using the wall charger supplied, HoloLens 2 devices can charge the battery to full in less than 65 minutes when the device is in standby. If those accessories aren't available, make sure the charger that's available can support at least 15W of power.

> [!NOTE]
> If possible, avoid using a PC to charge the device over USB, which is slow.

If the device is correctly booted and running, there are three ways to check the battery charge level:

- From the main menu of the HoloLens device UI.
- View the LED close to the power button (for a 40-percent charge, you should see at least two solid LEDS).
    - When the device is charging, the battery indicator lights up to indicate the current level of charge.  The last light will fade in and out to indicate active charging.
    - When your HoloLens is on, the battery indicator displays the battery level in five increments.
    - When only one of the five lights is on, the battery level is below 20 percent.
    - If the battery level is critically low and you try to turn on the device, one light will blink briefly, then go out.
- On your host PC, open **File Explorer** and look for your HoloLens 2 device on left side under **This PC**. Right-click the device, and select **Properties**. A dialog box will show the battery charge level.

If the device can't boot to the startup menu, note the LED appearance and device enumeration on the host PC. Then follow the [troubleshooting guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-troubleshooting). If the state of the device doesn't match any of the states listed in the troubleshooting guide, preform the [hard reset procedure](hololens-recovery.md#hard-reset-procedure) with the device connected to the power supply, not to your host PC. Wait at least one hour for the device to charge.

## Reset the device

Under certain circumstances, you may have to manually reset the device without using the software UI.

### Standard procedure

1. Unplug the Type-C cable to disconnect the device from the power supply or the host PC.

2. Press and hold the **power** button for 15 seconds. All LEDs should be off.

3. Wait 2-3 seconds, and then short-press the **power** button. The LEDs close to the power button will light up, and the device will begin to start up.

4. Connect the device to the host PC, and then open Device Manager. (For Windows 10, press the **Windows** key and then the **X** key, and then select **Device Manager**.) Make sure the device enumerates correctly as *Microsoft HoloLens* as shown in the following image:

### Hard-reset procedure

If the standard reset procedure didn't work, use the hard-reset procedure:

1. Unplug the Type-C cable to disconnect the device from the power supply or the host PC.

2. Hold down the **volume down** + **power** buttons for 15 seconds. The device will automatically restart.

4. Connect the device to the host PC.
5. Open Device Manager (for Windows 10 press the **Windows** key and then the **X** key, and then select **Device Manager**). Make sure the device enumerates correctly as *Microsoft HoloLens* as shown in the following image:

## Clean-reflash the device

In extraordinary situations, you may have to "clean-flash" the HoloLens 2. Please note that clean-reflash isn’t expected to affect the following issues:
- [Display color uniformity](hololens2-display.md)
- Booting with sound but no display output
- [1-3-5-LED pattern](hololens2-setup.md#lights-to-indicate-problems)
- [Overheating](hololens-environment-considerations.md#temperature-and-regulatory-information) 
- OS crashes (which are distinct from application crashes)

There are two ways to reflash the device. For both, you must first [install Advanced Recovery Companion from the Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8).

>[!WARNING]
>If you reflash your device, all your personal data, apps, and settings will be erased, including TPM-reset information.

By default, Advanced Recovery Companion is set to download the most recent feature release build, check here to read our [Release notes](hololens-release-notes.md#) to learn about the latest feature release. To get the latest HoloLens 2 Full Flash Update (FFU) package to reflash your device via Advanced Recovery Companion, [click here to download the latest monthly HoloLens 2 image](https://aka.ms/hololens2download). This version is the latest generally available build.

Before you start the reflash procedure, make sure the app is installed and running on your Windows 10 PC and ready to detect the device. Also ensure that your HoloLens is charged to a minimum of 40%.

### Normal procedure

1. While the HoloLens device is running, connect it to the Windows 10 PC where you previously opened the Advanced Recovery Companion app.
 
   The device will be automatically detected, and the Advanced Recovery Companion app UI will start the update process:

   ![HoloLens 2 clean reflash initial screen](images/ARC2.png)

3. Select the HoloLens 2 device in the Advanced Recovery Companion app UI, and follow the instructions to complete the reflash.

### Manual procedure

If the HoloLens 2 doesn't start correctly, you may need to put the device into Recovery mode:

1. Unplug the Type-C cable to disconnect the device from the power supply or the host PC.

2. Press and hold the **power** button for 15 seconds. All LEDs should turn off.

3. While pressing the **volume up** button, press and release the **power** button to start the device. Wait 15 seconds, and then release the **volume up** button. Only the middle LED of the five LEDs will light up.

4. Connect the device to the host PC, and open Device Manager. (For Windows 10 press the **Windows** key, and then the **X** key, and then select **Device Manager**.) Make sure the device enumerates correctly as Microsoft HoloLens as shown in the following image:

   ![HoloLens 2 MicrosoftHoloLensRecovery](images/MicrosoftHoloLensRecovery.png)

   The device will be automatically detected, and the Advanced Recovery Companion app UI will start the update process:

   ![HoloLens 2 clean reflash screen](images/ARC2.png)

6. Select the HoloLens 2 device in the Advanced Recovery Companion app UI, and then follow the instructions to complete the reflash.

## Download ARC without using the app store

If the IT environment prevents the use of the Windows Store app or limits access to the retail store, the IT administrator can make this app available through an "offline" deployment path.

 >[!NOTE]
 > - IT administrators can also distribute this app through System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) or Intune.
 > - This guide focuses on Advanced Recovery Companion, but the process can also be used for other "offline" apps.

Follow these steps to enable the deployment path:
1. Go to the [Microsoft Store for Business](https://businessstore.microsoft.com) and sign in using an Azure Active Directory identity.

1. Go to **Manage – Settings**. Turn on **Show offline apps** under **Shopping experience**.
1. Go to **shop for my group**, and search for [***Advanced Recovery Companion***](https://businessstore.microsoft.com/store/details/advanced-recovery-companion/9P74Z35SFRS8).
1. Change the **License Type** to ***offline***, and select **Manage**.
1. Under **Download the package for offline use**, select the second blue **Download** button. Make sure that the file extension is *.appxbundle*.

    - At this stage, if the Desktop PC has internet access, double-click the package to install the app.

    - If the destination PC has no internet connectivity, follow these steps:
       1. Select the unencoded license, and then select **Generate license**.
       2. Under **Required Frameworks**, select **Download**.
       3. Use DISM to apply the package with the dependency and license. From an administrator command prompt, run the following command:

          ```console
          C:\WINDOWS\system32>dism /online /Add-ProvisionedAppxPackage /PackagePath:"C:\ARCoffline\Microsoft.AdvancedRecoveryCompanion_1.19050.1301.0_neutral_~_8wekyb3d8bbwe.appxbundle" /DependencyPackagePath:"C:\ARCoffline\Microsoft.VCLibs.140.00.UWPDesktop_14.0.27629.0_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe.appx" /LicensePath:"C:\ARCoffline\Microsoft.AdvancedRecoveryCompanion_8wekyb3d8bbwe_f72ce112-dd2e-d771-8827-9cbcbf89f8b5.xml" /Region:all
          ```
            > [!NOTE]
            > The version number in this code example may not match the currently available version. You may have also chosen a different download location than in the example. Make any changes to the command as needed.

> [!TIP]
> When you plan to use Advanced Recovery Companion to install an FFU offline, it may be useful to download your flash image. [**Download the current image for HoloLens 2**](https://aka.ms/hololens2download).
